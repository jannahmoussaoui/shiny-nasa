**Contributors:** Jannah R. Moussaoui & Jason S. McCarley

**Project:** A Decision Making Demo

**Objective:** The goal of this project is create a shiny app that provides an activity to demonstrate the normativity of decisions made in solitude, within groups, and through the wisdom of crowds.

## (Overly ambitious) Future Directions
- Add de-biasing strategies (e.g., pre-mortem)
- Add a way to get at the widsdom of very big crowds
